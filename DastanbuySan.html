            <p>He is the Possessor of all Power, the Emperor who has raised nine skies and given
               light to the seven great stars. He is the Master of Knowledge and has exalted the
               body by infusing it with the soul. He has endowed man with wisdom and the sense of
               justice. Without matter or means He has created seven layers of earth and nine skies.
               Difficult things become easy and ordinary or extraordinary impediments are removed,
               all by means of the movements and effects of the stars
            </p>
            <p>The Lord has arranged the skies in such a manner that although the stars possess various
               qualities, producing various effects, and although He has given them the power to
               remain separate or to assemble and has endowed them with great influence, they cannot
               do other than obey His commands.

            <p>Whereas Venus and Jupiter, being auspicious, assure our good fortune, Saturn and Mars,
               being inauspicious, are responsible for our losses. Those who know the truth wherein
               lies the source of happiness and sorrow, inauspiciousness and grace - for the stars
               are but servants of the most just Emperor. The soldiers of His court can never step
               from the circle of His justice; nor can they do other than remain in conjunction with
               one another. If an auspicious star provokes pain, or if an auspicious one increases
               the beauty of the world by gentleness, both are devices for the adornment of life
               and this contradiction cannot be constructed as wantonness or indifference.
            </p>
            <p>A musician strikes his bow against the strings<br/> of his violin. As music issues from within the<br/> instrument, so joy emerges from the vibrations<br/> of sorrow. It is not in anger that the washerman<br/> beats his clothes against a stone.
            </p>
            <p>The cycle of death leads to the cycle of life. The Lord gives to man sorrow and joy,
               loftiness and lowliness, and these are the instruments of his well-being and the channels
               of his happiness. If a rich man gives to a poor man a few pice or thousands of rupees,
               if he gives bolts of silk or a simple blanket, he does, in fact, sustain the poor
               man and he performs generously. It would be a lack of wisdom to divide the gifts of
               the Lord into compartments of good and evil or, when we see inequality, to attribute
               this to an injustice of the Lord.
            </p>
            <p>It is by the grace of the Lord that this word of illusion, floating upon the waves
               of death, has been endowed with life. I know that my words are powerless to plumb
               the depths of these profound ideas, and that the ideas themselves are beyond the comprehension
               of the uninspired; however, I shall descend from rhetoric and speak in simple and
               direct style.
            </p>
            <p>The rotation of the skies is like the rotation of a hand-mill. You know there must
               be a person who rotates the mill ; why, then, do you not believe there is One who
               rotates the stars ? Into the spinning wheel of the skies a spindle has been inserted
               which pertains to the auspicious and inauspicious aspects of the stars. The wheel
               has spun veils which have been placed before the eyes of men ; but the inspired ones,
               who know the divine secrets, can see the Hand of the Lord behind these veils, and
               can know the reality of the Lord.

            <p>Praise the Lord who has created being and vanquished non-being ! Praise the Lord who
               has put an end to atrocity and has spread the light of justice ! By His wisdom He
               diminishes the influence of the powerful ; by His grace He increases the strength
               of the weak. The pebbles that slew the mighty elephant-mounted legions were dropped
               by a swallow, a mosquito killed the proud Nimrod. Truly there can be no understanding
               of these things other than as signs of the limitless power of the Lord These destructions
               were different from one another and they took place at different times. Tell me what
               star by its blandishments could have caused such things to happen ?

            <p>The Lord who has brought the world into being from non-being, may also bring the world
               to the Day of Judgement. The Lord who has created the world by His word 'Let it be
               I' may also end the world by His word. And who can question the Lord ?
            </p>
            <p>During these days the harmony of all music, the principle behind all things has been
               altered. The soldiers have turned against their captain. Without indulging in ornament
               we can say simply that the times have changed.
            </p>
            <p>Astronomers have told us that Saturn and Mars were in confluence in the sign of Cancer
               at the time when the courtly revelries of Yazdajird,last emperor of Iran, were disrupted
               by the Arab invasion. Today, also, Saturn and Mars are in confluence in Cancer and
               will so remain until the turmoil in the world has ended. This turmoil—the cruelty,
               bloodshed and degradation—issues from the inauspicious conjunction of these stars.
               But those who can read the truth will find the differences between these two periods
               quite obvious.
            </p>
            <p>The Arab invasion of Iran was the invasion of one country by another ; in India, however,
               the army has revolted against its own leaders. Religion was behind the invasion of
               Iran. Knowledge and wisdom had withered away and the country had become a desert—but
               the graces of Islam caused the desert to blossom and freed it of fire worship and
               slavery. In India, however, the people cannot be expected to offer the security of
               new laws. Iranians left the worship of fire and came to the worship of one God, but
               Indians have left the skirt of the just rulers and have been caught in the net of
               beastly men. Do you not see the similarity between the protecting <span style="font-style:italic">daman</span> (skirt) and the enslaving <span style="font-style:italic">dam</span> (net) , and between <span style="font-style:italic">dad</span> (justice) and <span style="font-style:italic">dad</span> (beast) ? In truth one cannot perceive of justice under other auspices than those
               of the British. The whips of the Arabs left scars, but these were soothed by the graces
               of Islam. Harmony and peace came after the warfare 28 and the afflictions of Iran
               were forgotten. If any good can come from this insurrection, then the subtle and discerning
               man who can see this good must explain it to me and so comfort my fearful heart. How
               strange it is that officers responsible for peace should rise in rebellion against
               their rulers, that soldiers should assassinate their leaders, and that neither should
               feel shame at these outrageous acts. 0 you who can see what is hidden and you who
               can distinguish between loss and benefit, know that this is the wrath of the Lord.
               The invasion of Iran was neither as devastating nor as full of despair as is the rebellion
               in India.

            <p>I am not so dull as to call the bright stars lightless, or to believe the high heavens
               are impoverished, nor am I so ignorant as to consider the effects of the stars as
               false, or the confluence of inauspicious stars an illusion ; for I know the terrible
               issue of the confluence of Saturn and Mars which took place one thousand years ago.
            </p>
            <p>I, who am entangled in the irremedial anxieties of the times, consider that those
               who have not seen the sign of Cancer, those who are not aware of the effects of Saturn
               and Mars but only of their names, should not now concern them¬selves with these things
               about which they do not know. These people should study the present which has concealed
               within it the secrets of the past and the future ; for the times, which so often undo
               the works of good men, did not, in fact, permit the British to be harmed by external
               powers. Rather, it was from within their own territory that the British armies were
               attacked.
            </p>
            <p>Readers of this book should know that I who, through the strokes of my pen scatter
               pearls on paper, have eaten the bread and salt of the British and, from my earliest
               childhood, have been fed from the table of these world conquerors.
            </p>
            <p>Seven or eight years ago the Mughal emperor of Delhi summoned me to his palace and
               asked me to write a history of the Timurid dynasty, for which he proposed to pay me
               six hundred rupees annually. I accepted his offer and began the work. Eventually the
               emperor's master of verse died and I was also appointed as the one responsible for
               the correction of the royal poems.
            </p>
            <p>I was aged and weak and bad become used to my corner of loneliness and quiet. Further,
               I had developed a deafness which was a source of great inconvenience to my friends
               and I could only watch the lips of those who spoke. Twice a week I visited the royal
               palace where, if it was his will, I would remain for a while in the presence of the
               king. If he did not emerge from his chambers I would sit briefly in the hall of private
               audience before returning to my home.
            </p>
            <p>During this time I used to take to the emperor whatever writing I had completed or
               send it by messenger. This was my connection with the court and the nature of my work.
               Although this small position gave me some restfulness and peace and was free from
               courtly entanglements, it assured me neither prosperity nor happiness. But even then
               the revolving skies were conspiring to destroy what little well-being I had.

            <p>We have a chronogram for this year which is expressed in the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">rast kheli bija</span>, which means unwarranted revolt. If you should ask I would tell you that suddenly,
               at noon on Monday, the sixteenth of <span style="font-style:italic">Ramazan</span>, 1273 A.H., which is the same as the eleventh of May, 1857, the walls and ramparts
               of the Red Fort shook with such force that the vibrations were felt in the four corners
               of the city. This was not an earthquake. On that infamous day rebellious soldiers
               from Meerut, faithless to the salt, entered Delhi thirsty for the blood of the British.
               It would not be surprising if the guards of Delhi's gates, being brothers in profession
               with the rebels, had entered into conspiracy with them. Ignoring their orders to protect
               the city, forgetting their loyalty to the salt, the guards welcomed their uninvited,
               or invited, guests. Swarming through the opened gates of Delhi, the intoxicated horsemen
               and rough foot soldiers ravished the city like mad¬men. They did not leave their bloody
               work until they had killed officers and Englishmen, wherever they found them, and
               had destroyed their houses.
            </p>
            <p>A few poor, reclusive men, who received their bread and salt by the grace of the British,
               lived scattered throughout different parts of the city, in lanes and by-lanes, but
               quite distant from one another. These humble, peaceful people did not know an arrow
               from an axe ; their hands were empty of the sword ; and even the sound of thieves
               in the dark night frightened them. These were not men who could do battle. They could
               do nothing but sit, helpless and grief-stricken, in their locked houses ; for no blade
               of grass can stop the swift flow of the running water.
            </p>
            <p>I was one of these helpless, stricken men. Shut in my room, I listened to the noise
               and tumult, and I heard it shouted that the guardian of the Red Fort and the British
               agent there had been murdered. From all sides one could hear the foot soldiers running
               and the hoof beats of the horse¬men and, looking out, one could see the earth stained
               by the blood of the rose-bodied. Every corner of the garden had become the graveyard
               of spring.
            </p>
            <p>Oh, pity those great men, who embodied wisdom, who personified justice—those courteous
               rulers bearing a good name ! Oh, pity those fairy-faced, slim-bodied women whose faces
               shone like the moon and whose bodies glittered like raw silver ! A thousand times
               pity the children, innocent of the world, who put roses and tulips to shame and whose
               step was more beautiful than that of the deer and the partridge ! All of these were
               sucked into the whirlpool of death and were drowned in an ocean of blood.
            </p>
            <p>Even Death himself—who strikes sparks of extinction and consumes by fire, who finally
               clothes all men in black---must wail at the bedside of the slaughtered, and wear mourn¬ing
               in grief for the murdered ones. The skies in their sorrow must fade like smoke, and
               the earth, like a cyclone, spin from its accustomed place.

            <p>Somehow this long and terrible day came to an end and darkness fell. The black-hearted,
               cruel killers made camp throughout the city ; they stabled their horses in the Red
               Fort and took the royal chambers for their sleeping rooms. Gradu¬ally news flowed
               in from distant towns : the rebel soldiers had murdered the officers in their barracks
               and open rebellion had broken out. All through the country soldiers and land¬lords
               had joined forces and become as one body in a shameful lust that only waves of blood
               could satisfy. As the straws of a broom are tied up with one string so the multitude
               of rebels were bound together by a single cord. Such cataclysmic strokes swept India
               that, if one sought prosperity or peace, no single grass blade would be found. Some
               of the soldiers, although they had no leaders, prepared themselves for battle by seizing
               guns, gunpowder and gunshot from the British. All the tactics they had learned they
               employed against their former teachers.

            <p>The heart is not stone or steel but will be moved. The eyes are not lifeless cracks
               in a wall but will shed tears at the panorama of death and at India's desolation.
               The city of Delhi was emptied of its rulers and peopled instead with creatures of
               the Lord who acknowledged no lord—as if it were a garden without a gardener, and full
               of fruitless trees.
            </p>
            <p>The raiders threw off all restraint and the merchants ceased paying taxes. Houses
               were abandoned and the apart¬ments were like free tables of booty to be plundered
               at will. In its shamelessness, the rabble, sword in hand, rallied to one group after
               another. And if peaceful, good people came into the bazaar they were made to acknowledge
               their defeat and humility before the lawless multitude. Throughout the day the rebels
               looted the city and at night they slept in silken beds.
            </p>
            <p>In the noblemen's houses there is no oil for the lamps. In total darkness they must
               await the flash of lightning, and so find the glass and jug with which to quench their
               thirst.
            </p>
            <p>How can I describe the lack of judgement, the indiffer¬ence of these times ? Those
               rough labourers who spend their days digging and selling mud, have now found in it
               pieces of gold. And those others whose assemblies were illuminated by the blaze of
               flowers are plunged into failure and despair.
            </p>
            <p>With the sole exception of the wife and daughter of the police chief, the ornaments
               of all the young women of Delhi , have been seized by the black-hearted, cowardly
               robbers. Bereft of their embellishments, these women have been further debauched of
               their remaining charm and grace by the newly rich sons of beggars, and they have no
               choice but to satisfy the conceit of this rabble. Those loving and courteous people
               who sheltered the coquetries of the young women with their respect and affection,
               can do nothing now but bow beneath the wickedness of these newly rich, vile-natured
               ones who are so filled with pride that to see them you would say they were not men
               but whirlwinds puffed up with conceit. These lowly men, engrossed only in their own
               self-importance, are but small blades of grass floating pompously on the wide water.
            </p>
            <p>Noble men and great scholars have fallen from power ; and the lowly ones, who have
               never known wealth or honour, now have prestige and unlimited riches. One whose father
               wandered dust-stained through the streets now proclaims himself ruler of the wind.
               One whose mother borrowed from her neighbour fire with which to light her kitchen
               declares himself sovereign of fire. These are the men who hope to rule over fire and
               wind and we unhappy ones have no desires left but for moments of respite and a little
               justice.

               and friends ? In this anarchy brave men are afraid of their own shadows and soldiers
               rule over dervish and king alike. Is this not cause for grief ? Do these heartbreaking
               events not merit our tears ? None can ridicule our sorrowing, for to lament such wrongs
               is not unbelief or lack of faith.

            <p>This prisoner of loneliness, this afflicted Ghalib, now resumes his narrative of grief.
               When these wayward, hostile rebels first entered Delhi, they brought treasure with
               them. This they deposited with the royal treasury and they bowed their heads on the
               royal thresbhold. Rebellious armies from various directions converged on Delhi and
               assembled here. When the emperor could no longer control this army, the army itself
               took control into its own hands and the king was rendered helpless.
            </p>

            <p>Although it is worth mentioning, I have not yet said that these adventurers, before
               starting towards Delhi, opened the doors of the prisons and set the prisoners free.
               In their newly found liberty these culprits came to the royal court and knelt in obeisance
               to the emperor demanding governorships ; these faithless slaves who had escaped their
               masters came to kiss the royal threshhold and demand fertile lands for themselves.
            </p>
            <p>No one has told me, and I am at a loss to understand, how all who sought audience
               were allowed to go before the emperor; how every seeker after shelter was, by the
               royal authorities, given shelter. This can only be considered as part of the strangeness
               of the times.
            </p>
            <p>At the moment, inside and outside of Delhi, there is an encampment of approximately
               fifty thousand cavalry and in¬fantry ; and the British, those possessors of knowledge
               and wisdom, control no ground except for a ridge at the western edge of the city.
               Here they have skillfully arranged their batteries and so have converted it into a
               kind of fortress. On all four sides they have fixed their fire-breathing, lightning-striking
               cannons ; and, in this manner, through their perse¬verance they have made a haven
               of peace in a land of adversity.
            </p>
            <p>The soldiers have seized guns from the armoury, which they have set up on the ramparts
               of the city, and the rebels are now actually confronted with the courageous British
               officers. The heavy smoke from the guns and cannons is like dark clouds hanging in
               the sky and the noise is like the rain of hail¬stones. Cannon fire is heard all day
               long, as if stones were falling from the skies.
            </p>
            <p>These are the hot months of May and June and the heat has become intolerable. The
               sun has entered into the sphere of Gemini, and the heat increases steadily, until
               it seems that the sun itself is consumed by its own fire. People who lived comfortably
               in cool and ventilated houses are now scorching under the flaming sun and they spend
               their nights in restlessness on burning stones.
            </p>
            <p>Had Isfandyar been engaged in this war, he would, in spite of his renowned bravery,
               have lost his will and confidence. If Rustam had heard this story he would have been
               overcome by despair.
            </p>
            <p>The soldiers who have assembled from all parts of India leave their encampments When
               the sun is well above the horizon and go forth to fight the lion-hearted British.
               They return to their camps just before sunset. That is the situation outside the town.
            </p>
            <div class="l">Now I shall relate an incident which has occurred inside the town.</div>

            <p>A servant who was filled with pride and a hunger for power became the secret enemy
               of his master. He believed that if his master lived, it would become known that he
               (the servant) had wrongfully accumulated treasure. Wishing harm to the master, who
               was called Ahsanullah Khan, some rebels sought him in his mansion, but it so happened
               that the Hakim Sahib was with the emperor. These impetuous people then rushed to the
               Red Fort and there besieged the Hakim. But out of gracious love for his faithful subject,
               the emperor threw him¬self over the Hakim, and so saved him from death. Although his
               life was saved, the mischief was not finished until his house was completely devastated.
               That mansion, which in beauty and ornament, was equal to the picture galleries of
               China, was looted and the roofs were burned. The great beams and the inlaid panels
               of the ceiling were reduced to ashes. The walls were so completely blackened by smoke
               it seemed that, in grief, the mansion wore a black mantle.

            <p>Unless he were a bastard, the meanest slave would not behave in such a manner towards
               his master. This contempt¬ible man, this wretch untrue to the salt, with cheeks pitted
               by smallpox and a gaping mouth, whose eyes stare in shameless¬ness, considers himself
               a Venus. He walks with swaying hips and believes his gait lovelier than that of the
               partridge. I have purposely not mentioned his name as he is the infamous son of a
               tramp. Now that I have heaped coals of fire upon the head of this man, I shall resume
               my story.
            </p>
            <p>The rebel armies were assembling from various places in India. Since the name of the
               emperor was associated with the revolt, many officers from great distances had joined
               the rebellion. A nobleman of Farrukhabad, Tafazzul Husain Khan, who previously had
               not explicitly expressed his loyalty to the emperor now paid homage to him from afar
               and signed his message as from an old royal servant.
            </p>
            <p>Khan Bahadur Khan, a misguided nobleman who was thirsty for power, collected around
               him some soldiers from Bareilly and proclaimed himself leader. He sent to the emperor
               one hundred gold coins, and horses and elephants caprizoned with silver paraphernalia.
            </p>
            <p>May the effects of the evil eye be warded off ! Nawwab Yusuf All Khan Bahadur, the
               sun-symbolled ruler of Rampur, the successor to his parents and grandparents, enjoys
               ties with the British government so strong that, even after a lapse of one thousand
               years, they would be impossible to sever. Thi s ruler sent only a verbal message to
               the rebels and so circumvented them.
            </p>
            <p>In Lucknow the army had separated itself from the British and most of them left the
               city and went over to their relatives in other towns. However some officers, together
               with their soldiers, made camp in Bailey Guard and bravely barred the gates of the
               town (against the rebels).
            </p>
            <p>Ignoring the small group of distinguished British, Shara¬fuddaulah, a wise man of
               considerable understanding who had been wazir during the days of the Nawwab of Avadh,
               installed the ten-year old son of Nawwab Wajid All Shah as wazir of India's emperor
               and declared himself chamberlain and deputy wazir. Surely this renowned man had captured
               the fabulous huma in his net. When these things were done he sent a messenger to Delhi
               with appropriate gifts. The messenger arrived in the city where he remained for two
               days before seeking audience with the emperor and presenting him with two wind-swift
               horses, two elephants as high as mountains, one hundred and twenty-one gold coins,
               and a golden cup which was ornamented with priceless pearls of many colours. To the
               queen inside the women's palace, he sent a pair of armlets, studded with diamonds.
            </p>
            <p>All of this grandeur was like a flickering lamp, as if the evil eye was watching the
               short-lived splendour ; for, after the arrival of these rare gifts from the kingdom
               of Avadh, this fable of pomp and splendour, which equalled that of Alexander and the
               fabulous mirror, and Jamshid and the wonderful cup, came to an end. No sooner had
               the din and clamour of the rebel army caused the eyes of fortune to turn towards the
               emperor than those same eyes turned away from him. I put it in different words when
               I say that the emperor's auspicious star reached such lofty heights that it went quite
               out of sight of the world's eyes.

            <p>The lapse of time from the eleventh of May to the fourteenth of September is actually
               four months and four days. However, since the town fell on a Monday, and was also
               re-captured on a Monday, it is as if the city were lost and retaken on the same day.
               The victors killed all whom they found on the streets. Those of noble birth and position,
               in order to protect their honour, which was all that remained to them, stayed inside
               their locked houses.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the black-hearted (rebel) army attempted to escape but others, out of pride,
               were determined to fight and confronted the lion-hearted conquerors. In their own
               view they were attacking the enemy but in actual fact they were destroying the honour
               and prestige of Delhi.
            </p>
            <p>For two or three days all the roads from Kashmiri Gate to Chandni Chauk became battle-grounds.
               Delhi Gate, Turkman Gate and Ajmeri Gate were under the control of the Indian army.
               The house of sorrow in which I dwell, down-hearted and dejected, is situated exactly
               between Kashmiri Gate and Delhi Gate. Although we had locked the gate of our lane,
               at certain times we were able to open it and bring in food.
            </p>
            <p>I have told you that when the angry lions entered the town, they killed the helpless
               and the weak and they burned their houses. It may be that such atrocities always occur
               after conquest.
            </p>
            <p>Seeing the anger and fury, the townspeople turned pale. Hordes of men and women, commoners
               and noblemen, poured out of Delhi from the three gates and took shelter in small communities
               and tombs outside the city. There they remained, hoping, at a later time, either to
               return to Delhi or to move on to another town.

            <p>In my heart I felt no dread nor did my legs tremble in fear. I said to myself that
               I am not a wrong-doer and deserve no punishment, for the English do not kill the innocent.
               The atmosphere of Delhi was not unfavourable to me and I believed I should entertain
               no thought of escape. Now, in desolation, I sit in a corner of my house with my pen
               as my sole companion. My eyes weep tears and from my pen issue words of anguish.

            <p>All has been written in eternity and nothing can be changed. Our fates are decreed
               in an eternity that has no beginning and no end ; and each of us has received accord¬ing

               ready excitement, all the astonishing things which are occurring.

            </p>
            <p>At noon on Friday, the twenty-sixth of Muharram, which is the eighteenth of September,
               an eclipse occurred when the sun, which sheds joy and light upon the world, entered
               into a new constellation. The darkness so frightened the people that inside and outside
               of the city the misguided rebels fled like swine, and the victors captured the city
               and the Fort. The horror of mass arrests, assassinations, and slaughter now reached
               our lane and the people shook with fear. In this lane there are ten or twelve homes
               and only one entrance. There is no well inside the lane. Most of the people have left—the
               women clutching their infants to their breasts and the men with their belongings on
               their shoulders—and only a few of us have remained behind. We shut the door of the
               lane from the inside and piled stones against the entrance, so closing it completely.
               Our little lane which was shadowed is now shuttered.

            </div>
            <p>During all this turmoil something occurred which was of considerable help to us. The
               ruler of Patiala, Raja¬Narendra Singh, magnificent as Mars, exalted as the skies,
               supports the conquerors in this battle ; his army has been assisting the British from
               the very beginning. Some of the raja's highest officials live in this lane : Hakim
               Mahmud Khan, Hakim Murtaza Khan, Hakim Ghulamullah Khan—all of them progeny of Hakim
               Sharif Khan, who dwells now in paradise—and themselves very honourable and famous
               men. The double row of their extensive homes stretches for some distance and for the
               past ten years I have been the neighbour of one of these rich men, Hakim Mahmud Khan
               who, with his family and relations, lives a very respectable life according to the
               traditions of his ancestors. The remaining two stay in comfort and honour with the
               raja In Patiala. When the British recapture of Delhi was imminent, the raja, out of
               his great kindness, had arranged with the powerful and warlike British that as soon
               as Delhi was reconquered, guards from Patiala would be posted at the gate of the lane
               to prevent the British white militia from damaging the houses or molesting their inhabitants.
            </p>
            <p>Occasionally during the course of this narrative I have bad to speak of other things
               (than the actual rebellion) ; however, after this digression, I shall return to the
               main topic. Since the fourteenth of September every door in the entire city of Delhi
               has been closed. There is neither merchant nor buyer ; there is ho seller of wheat
               from whom we can buy flour, nor is there a washerman to whom we can give our soiled
               garments ; there is no barber to trim hair, or sweeper to clean our floors. However,
               as I have written earlier, during these five days it was possible for us to leave
               the lane for water and occasionally to get flour. But later even this became impossible.
               The door of the lane was blocked with stones and the mirror of our hearts was clouded
               with sorrow.
            </p>
            <div class="l">All our endeavours have been chilled and sorrow now burns in our blood like fire.</div>
            <p>Gradually, whatever provisions we had in our houses were consumed. Although we had
               used the water with great care, not a single drop remained in cup or jar. The people
               have lost all their power to endure and the illusion that passing our days courageously
               would bring an end to our hunger now faded completely and we were hungry and thirsty
               throughout the days and nights.
            </p>
            <div class="lg">
               <div class="l">Oh, pity our wailing, beggary and dishonour !</div>
               <div class="l">A hundred times pity our helplessnesq, affliction</div>
               <div class="l">and poverty !</div>
            </div>
            <p>As I have said earlier, on the third day the soldiers of the army of the Maharaja
               of Patiala arrived and began patrolling. In this way the inhabitants of the lane were
               relieved of their fear of looters. After saying 'Come what may!' they asked permission
               of the soldiers to leave the lane. As the patrolling was done out of friendship and
               not out of enmity, the people were allowed to go as far as the bazaar of the Chauk.
               Beyond the Chauk mass slaughter was rampant and the streets were filled with horror.
               These tormented and helpless people opened the gate of the lane, but it was impossible
               to find a water-carrier or water-skin. Therefore they selected one man from every
               house and, together with two of my servants, managed to procure some brackish water.
               They filled their jars and pots with this salty water since the sweet water was at
               some distance and it was not possible to travel so far. In such a way they quenched
               their fire with brackish water. The other name for this fire is thirst.
            </p>
            <p>Those who went out for water told us that in the lane beyond which we are not allowed
               to go, the soldiers had broken into several houses. In these houses there are now
               neither sacks of flour nor pots of oil. I told them that the Lord's creatures do not
               speak of pots, sacks, flour and oil. Our bread is with the Bread-Giver who will not
               forsake us. It is the work of Satan to be ungrateful for the gifts of the Lord. In
               these days we think of ourselves as prisoners and we are, in truth, passing our days
               like prisoners. Nobody comes to visit us and we receive no news. We cannot leave the
               lane so we are unable to see what is happening with our own eyes. In fact, it isas
               if our ears were deaf and could not hear, and our eyes were blind and could not see.
               In addition to this trouble we have neither bread to eat nor water to drink. One day
               clouds suddenly appeared and it rained. We tied up a sheet in our courtyard and placed
               our jars beneath it and in this way we collected water. It is said that the clouds
               take up water from the river and so spread rain over the earth. But this time the
               cloud was like puma and gathered water from the very fountain of life. It was as if
               this treasure, for which Alexander had searched during the days of his sovereignty,
               was found by one in anguish during the days of destruction.

            </div>
            <p>This is the sixty-second year of my life. For many years I have been straining the
               dust of this world through a sieve ; and for the last fifty years I have been opening
               the depths of my heart through poetry. I was five years old when my father Abdullah
               Beg Khan Bahadur died—may the Lord shower His innumerable graces on his spirit ! My
               uncle Nasrullah Beg Khan Bahadur adopted me as his son and raised me with con¬siderable
               indulgence. When I was nine years old this uncle, who was also my patron, slipped
               into the sleep of death and with this death my fortune also slept. My uncle, an estimable
               man of position and prestige, was the captain of four hundred horsemen and a loyal
               associate of General Lord Lake Bahadur. Through the kindness of this victorious and
               generous leader he was appointed overlord of two parganas near Agra. After his death
               these parganas reverted to the British government and in place of this jagir my brother
               and I were awarded a pension, which became the source of my comfort and livelihood.
               I received the pension from the treasury of the Delhi Collectorate until the end of
               April 1857, when the treasury was closed. Now I am con¬fronted by misfortune and my
               heart is the house of anxiety. Earlier I had only my wife—no son or daughter. Nearly
               five years ago I adopted two orphan children who had belonged to my wife's family.
               I am extremely fond of these sweet-tongued children who, in the extremity of my misfortune,
               are the flowers of my life.
            </p>
            <p>At the age of thirty, my brother, who is two years younger than I, went mad. For the
               past thirty years he has been living quietly and inoffensively in a house which is
               situated approximately two thousand paces from my home. His wife and daughters, together
               with their children and maid-servants, have departed and have left the crazy master
               of the house and all his belongings in the care of an aged darban and a maid-servant.
               Even if I bad magic powers I could not possibly, during such times, have brought these
               three persons or their possessions to my home. Because of this I am suffering grievously
               and my heart is troubled. The two children whom I have raised with such indulgence
               ask me to give them fruits, milk and sweets but I cannot satisfy their wishes. Alas,
               how can I explain that as long as I live I shall struggle for bread and water, and
               for a shroud after my death ? Day in and day out I think only of whether my brother
               has eaten, how he sleeps at night. My lack of in¬formation is so complete that I do
               not know if he is living or if he has died under his afflictions.

            <div class="l"><span style="font-size: 130%"><span style="font-style:italic">On my lips are wailings and sighs ; and on my lips, 0 Lord, is my final breath !</span></span></div>
            <p>These incidents which I have narrated are painful but the incidents I have not told
               of are heart-breaking. However, I expect those in authority will listen with compassion
               to my sorrowful story and, after hearing it, will see that justice is done. In this
               old age I am like the flickering morning lamp or like the sun which will soon. go
               down. I do not mean as the full lamplight or the spreading rays of the mid-day sun
               but as the last drops of oil in the lamp at morning make a dim light or as the light
               of the sun grows weak at evening—this is my situation. Two years ago I sent a panegyric
               in praise of the just, exalted Queen Victoria, splendid as the stars. This was sent
               to London from Delhi by way of Bombay through the courtesy of Lord Ellenborough, a
               renowned administrator who valued talent and who, through his generosity, was my patron
               during the time he was governor.

            <p>Who could have thought that the way out of my difficulties would have been made so
               easy, and in such a direct manner ! Suddenly, after three months, an auspicious courier
               arrived bearing a courteous letter from , Lord Ellenborough, that cyprus of the garden
               of sovereignty. This letter was written in English, affectionately, and reported that
               the pane¬gyric had been received and had been entrusted for presenta¬tion at the court
               of the queenHardly thirty days had passed since the arrival of this auspicious and
               welcome reply when I received a letter from the gracious official, Mr. Resington,
               saying, that 'with regard to the panegyric sent to us through Lord Ellenborough, it
               is pointed out that the petitioner, in respect to the norms of administrative procedure,
               should channel his petition through the administrator in India.'Therefore, in obedience
               to this request, a petition was sent to the queen of England through that administrator
               who is magnificent as Alexander, splendid as Faridun—Lord Canning Nawwab Governor-General
               Bahadur. In this petition it was re¬quested that, as the kings of Rum, Iran and other
               countries had rewarded their poets and well-wishers by filling their mouths with pearls,
               weighing them in gold and granting them villages and recompense, the exalted queen
               should bestow upon Ghalib, the petitioner, the title of Mihr-Khwan, and present him
               with the robe of honour and a few crumbs from her bounteous table—that is, in English,
               a 'pension'.
            </p>
            <p>The exalted Nawwab Governor-General Bahadur was pleased to lighten my grief-stricken
               heart with the happy tidings that my petition had been sent to England. At this fortunate
               news I was extravagantly happy, so much so that I could scarcely contain my joy. Four
               months later a reply to my petition came in the form of a friendly letter from the
               pen of the respected Mr. Russell Clerk Bahadur. So was the period of my expectations
               and unfulfilled desires prolonged. I have no doubt that had the administration of
               India not been disturbed during the recent revolt and had the course of justice not
               been diverted at the hands of ungrateful soldiers, who did not fear the Lord, a royal
               decree would have been issued from England satisfying all my desires, and my eyes
               and my heart would have rejoiced in mutual merriment. Now I have nothing but these
               letters of good omen, which are a talisman on the arm of wisdom and remind me of my
               deep longings. I hold my heart in my hands and I weep tears of blood as a token of
               my great agony.

            </div>
            <p>On Wednesday, the thirty-first September, seventeen days after victory and the closing
               of the door of our lane, news was brought that looters had raided the house of my
               brother and the other houses in that street. However the lives of my mad brother,
               Mirza Yusuf Khan, and of the two aged servants were spared. During the tumult two
               Hindus asked for shelter in his house ; and through the help of these Hindus the old
               darban and maid servant did everything possible to procure food and drinking water.
               It may be worth mentioning that during this storm and turmoil the nature of calamity
               is different in every lane and bazaar. The manner of killing and looting by the soldiers
               is not uniform but varies, and whether a soldier shows kindness or unkindness depends
               on his individual nature. Orders have been given to spare the lives of those who do
               not resist these assaults, but whosoever does resist them will lose his life along
               with his possessions. It is believed that those who were killed were ones who did
               not show obedience (to the British) and it is widely known that although looting was
               common, killing was generally abjured. Even In the few incidents, in two or three
               lanes, where the soldiers killed first and then looted, the lives of old men and women
               and children have been spared.
            </p>
            <p>Now the steed of my pen halts. Let me cry out that the steed may again go forth !
               0 you who commend justice and you lovers of truth who condemn injustice, if your tongue
               and your heart are one in this, for the sake of the Lord, think of what we have done
               ! Although everyone knows that disloyalty is a sin, without reason for enmity or cause
               for envy we raised our swords against our masters and we killed helpless women, and
               infants playing in their cradles. The British rose up in revenge against such atrocity
               and, in order to punish the transgressors, deployed their armies with care. Their
               anger at the citizens of Delhi was so great that, after capturing the city, one would
               think they would leave not even a dog or a cat alive. However, although their hearts
               were full of the fire of fury, they res¬trained themselves. Women and children were
               not molested. No general guarantee was offered for the protection of life or property
               because they were determined to distinguish between the guilty and the innocent and
               only those called for question¬ing were allowed to approach the authorities.

            <p>Most of the citizens had fled the city but some, caught between hope and despair,
               are still living inside the walls. So far no information has been received concerning
               those hiding in lonely places outside of Delhi. Those outside and those still living
               inside are both in great distress and there is no cure for their misery. If only each
               could know the fate of the other, whether they were alive or dead, much of their grief
               and anxiety would be allayed. This lack of knowledge is such that wherever one is,
               one is in despair. The hearts of the helpless inhabitants of the city, and those of
               the grief-stricken people outside, are filled with sorrow, and they are afraid of
               mass slaughter. Monday, the fifth of October, was a day of calamity. Suddenly, at
               noon, white soldiers scaled the wall near the closed entrance of our lane, climbed
               over the rooftops, and from there jumped down into the street. The guards of Raja
               Narendra Singh tried to intercept them but were unsuccessful. Ignoring the small houses
               nearby, the soldiers entered directly into my house. They did not, in their consideration,
               touch my possessions but took me, my two children, two or three servants and a few
               good neighbours to the wise and experienced Colonel Brown' who was staying in the
               merchant Qutbuddin's mansion, situated on this side of the Chauk at a distance of
               some furlongs. Colonel Brown talked with me gently and humanely, asking of me my name
               only, but of the others their profession, and so dismissed me politely. I thanked
               the Lord, praised the courteous Colonel Brown and returned home.
            </p>
            <p>During the evening of October seventh I heard a salute of twenty-one guns, of which,
               although I was pleased to hear it, I failed to understand the meaning. I remembered
               that on the arrival of the Lieutenant-Governor Bahadur there is a salute of seventeen
               guns ; when the Nawwab Governor-General Bahadur arrives nineteen shots are fired ;
               but I was at a loss to know the reason for the twenty-one gun salute. The following
               day, although on this point neither was my knowledge increased nor my ignorance decreased,
               I came to the conclusion that the British, those levellers of the high and the low,
               had somewhere won a victory over the rebels. In Bareilly, Farrukhabad and Lucknow
               there are still bands of rebels engaged in extending the rebellion and the futile
               struggle. May the Lord cause the blood to run from their hearts, and may He wither
               their hands, for their hearts and hands are openly engaged in this warfare. In the
               areas of Sonh and Nub the Mewatis have run amuck as if crazy men had thrown off their
               shackles and rampaged. Under the devil's guidance, the rebel Tularam, who was fighting
               in Rewari, joined forces with the Mewatis, and this group has been fighting the British
               savagely in the plains and on the mountains. The 'warfare is so bitter that it seems
               as if the entire land of India is engulfed in whirling storms and flaming fires.
            </p>
            <p>In these painful circumstances, the beginning of which I do not remember and the end
               of which I cannot know, if I have seen anything except tears, then may the holes of
               my eyes be filled with dust ! Since my eyes have seen only the black day of misfortune
               I have seen nothing, for it is impossi¬ble to see in darkness. Except for the day
               I was taken out by the white soldiers, I have not been out of my house, put my foot
               on the threshold, walked into the lane or bazaar, or seen the Chauk even from a distance.
               It is as if the wise poet Nizami Ganjawi had said it for me and with my lips :
            </p>

            <p>Because of wounds which resist all healing and griefs which defy all cure, I have
               been like a dead man. I was raised up for judgement and now, for the punishment of
               my transgressions, I am suspended in the pit of hell. I can do nothing but exist in
               this prison of helplessness and despair.

            <div class="l">How shall I endure if what happens to me today falls again to my lot tomorrow ?</div>
            <p>In this book I have, from the beginning to the end, told only of those events which
               have actually occurred to me or of which I have personally beard. One should not think
               that the events I have learned of through hearsay are lies, or that I have diminished
               their intensity in the writing. I seek the shelter of the Lord from these unwarranted
               arrests and I seek my salvation in the truth. My eyes cannot see, my heart is a prisoner
               of grief, my lips are silent, and my ears receive alms from the tongues of the people.
               'How degrading is this help¬less beggary ! Perhaps I should have begun my story of
               the capture of Delhi by relating the fate of the emperor and his sons, about which
               I have not yet written. The reason I have not is that the treasure of my writing is
               derived from what I hear, and there are many things yet to be heard. Certainly when
               I am freed from this confinement I shall gather information about what I have still
               not heard and shall write it as confidences from an informed person. Out of deference
               to me I hope that my readers will be patient with the disarrangement of sequence.

            <p>Monday, the nineteenth of October, should be erased from the calendar. Like a fire-breathing
               dragon that day engulfed the world when in the morning the unfortunate darban brought
               the relieving news of my brother's death. He told me that this traveller ,speeding
               on the path of death (Yusuf Mirza) had been afflicted with a high fever for five days
               and, close to midnight, had departed from this world. Oh, do not speak to me, I beg
               you, of water or of the kerchief to clean the face, of the man who bathes the dead
               body or digs the grave, or of !Nicks or mortar ! Please tell me how I can go out (of
               this lane), where to take this dead body, and in what graveyard to bury it ? In the
               bazaar it is impos¬sible to get cloth, either good or bad. It is as if labourers and
               earth-diggers had never existed in the city. The Hindus can carry their dead to the
               shores of the river and burn them, but the Muslims dare not go abroad, even in groups
               of two or three, so how can their dead be borne from the city ?
            </p>
            <p>The neighbours took pity on my plight and offered to perform this task. With one Patiala
               soldier leading them, they took two servants and set out. They bathed the dead body
               and wrapped it in two or three white sheets which they had taken from my house. They
               dug a grave in the mosque adjoining my house and put the dead body in the pit before
               returning.

            <p>During the week in which the British captured the city, those wise and esteemed men,
               Aminuddin Khan Bahadur and Muhammad Ziyauddin Khan Bahadur, in order to uphold their
               dignity and in the hope of bettering their positions, decided to leave the city. In
               addition to their wives and children they had with them three elephants and forty
               horses and they set out for the pargana of Loharu, which is their ancestral estate.
               First they went to Mihrauli, where they stayed in the luminous and sanctified burial
               ground. During this time the plundering soldiers besieged their encampment and did
               not leave until they had taken from them everything they owned except for the clothes
               they wore. Only the three elephants, which their faithful and kindly companions had
               taken away before the looting began, remained, like three great burnt-out silos, as
               symbols of disaster. These people, after suffering this calamitous looting, set out
               for Dujana, stripped of all their possessions. The illus.. trious and warm-hearted
               ruler of Dujana, Hasan Ali Khan Bahadur, welcoming them with affection and generosity,
               took them to Dujana, and told them to consider his house as their home.
            </p>
            <p>In brief, this good natured leader (Hasan All Khan) showed the same courteous manner
               towards his guests as was shown by the king of Iran towards the fugitive Humayun.
               When the Commissioner Bahadur heard of this story he sum¬moned these men to him and
               they returned to Delhi. At first the commissioner spoke to them sarcastically but
               when he received only polite answers he desisted and allowed them to stay near the
               chamberlain's palace in the Fort. Because of the sequence of the story I have not
               been able to tell of all the outrage and looting which fell to the lot of this family.
               I can only say that they were robbed in Mihrauli and also in Delhi. ,While the masters
               were away their homes were pillaged and all that they had carried with them was seized
               by looters in Mihrauli. Only the people themselves reached Dujana unharmed. Their
               palaces were plundered and only the bricks and stones were left behind. Neither their
               silver and gold was spared, nor a single thread of their clothes or bedding. May the
               Lord pity these guiltless ones and may their inauspicious beginning come to an auspicious
               end ! May they find comfort after calamity !
            </p>
            <p>It was Saturday, the seventeenth of October, when these distinguished men returned
               to the city and, as I have said earlier, they stayed at the Fort. Two or three days
               after this incident the army was ordered to apprehend Abdur Rahman, the ruler of Jhajjar,
               and they brought him in like a culprit. He was put in a small corner of the Diwan-i-Am
               of the Fort and all his jagir was confiscated by the British. On Friday, the thirty-first
               of October, the army seized Ahmad All Khan, the ruler of Farrukhnagar, and brought
               him, in the same manner as they had brought Abdur Rahman Khan, to a secluded place
               in the Delhi Fort. Farrukhnagar then became a target for the swift-handed looters,
               and the possessions of the inhabitants of this town also were plundered. Bahadur Jung
               Khan, the ruler of Dadri and Bahadur¬garb, was captured on Monday, November second,
               and arrangements were made to put him in the Fort. On Saturday, November seventh,
               Raja Nahar Singh, ruler of Ballabhgarh, was added to this company. In this way all
               the noblemen who lived at a distance were brought to the Fort. I should say that the
               jagirs under the Delhi agency are equal in number to the days of the week. They. are
               Jhajjar, Bahadurgarh, Ballabhgarb, Lamm, Farrukhnagar,Dujana and Pataudi. As I have
               said earlier, five of these fagirdars are in the Fort, and the remaining two, the
               jagirdars of Pataudi and Dujana, are pierced by the arrows of fear. Let us see what
               their all-seeing eyes behold and what befalls them.
            </p>
            <p>It is no secret that Muzaffaruddaulah Saifuddin Haidar Khan and Zulfaqarrudin Haidar
               Khan, who carry the title of Husain Mirza, like many other respectable men during
               these stormy days fled the city with their wives and children. They went into the
               wilderness and left behind them their homes, filled with precious possessions. The
               adjacent houses, palaces and mansions of these jagirdars were so vast that on surveying
               them they would be found to be, if not equal to the area of a town, surely equal to
               that of a village. These great palaces, being completely uninhabited, were ransacked
               by the looters. In the night following the morning on which Raja Nahar Singh was captured
               some heavy and less precious things such as curtains, canopies, tents, and rich coverings
               and carpets, which had been left behind in the palaces, accidentally caught fire.
               The flames leapt up and all of the wood, walls and stones were burned. These buildings
               are so near to my house on the western side that, from my roof, I could see the glare
               of the roaring fire ; the hot smoke reached my face and my eyes and a strong west
               wind blew ashes over my body. Music comes freely like a gift from the home of a neighbour
               : why then should not fire from a nearby house shower ashes upon me ?
            </p>
            <p>The speed of my pen is like the speed of a half-dead ant, and it is difficult to put
               all of this on paper for the benefit of my readers.Nothing more can be said of the
               fate of the Mughal princes than that some were shot and devoured by the dragon of
               death ; and some were hung by their necks with ropes and, in their twisting, their
               spirits left them. A few unfortunates are imprisoned, others have fled, wretched and
               disorder. ed, into the wilderness ; and the aged and fragile Mughal emperor is under
               trial by the court. The jagirdars of Jliajjar, Ballabhgarh, and Farrukh-nagar were
               executed separately on different days. Their lives were ended in such a manner that
               none could say blood had been spilled. In January 1858, the Hindus were given a proclamation
               of freedom by which they were allowed to live again in the city, and these people
               have begun to return from the places where they had found refuge. But the houses of
               the dis¬possessed Muslims had long remained empty and were so covered with vegetation
               that the walls seemed to be made of grass—and every blade of grass tells that the
               house of the Muslim is still empty.
            </p>
            <p>Probably because of the spying of devilish informants, the city administrator learned
               that the home of Raja Narendra Singh Bahadur's physicians had become the rendezvous
               and refuge of the Muslims. It would be no surprise if some of these troublesome, evil-tongued
               informers are here also. Because of them, on Tuesday, February second, the city administrator
               entered that house and took away with him sixty innocent refugees along with the masters
               of the house. Although these people were held in confinement for several days and
               nights the dignity of their position was respected. On Friday, February fifth, Hakim
               Mahmud Khan; Hakim Murtaza Khan and his nephew Abdul Hakim Khan, who went by the name
               of Hakim Kale, were released. On Friday, February twelfth, a few more people were
               released and on Saturday, February thirteenth, others were permitted to leave ; but
               more than half were ordered to remain in the prison. Because of this terrible calamity
               which has befallen my neighbourhood, and the storm which has swept through my lane,
               the heart of this grief-stricken, suffering dervish is distracted. In spite of everything,
               during all these arrests and seizures, I was not challenged. But even now I am uneasy
               all the time and .at night I sleep restlessly.
            </p>
            <p>During the magnificent month that extends from February until the month of Farwardin,
               when the sun takes one month to enter into the sign of Aries, and which is really
               the first month of spring, when the light of the sun becomes warm, news went round
               that the benevolent ruler, glorious as the sun and exalted as the stars, the Chief
               Com¬missioner Sir John Lawrence, was about to arrive. Since it has been my practice
               to send a panegyric to whoever comes as ruler of India, and particularly of Delhi,
               I composed a gasida of congratulations and welcome in praise of his lordship. This
               was posted on Friday, February nineteenth. In the evening of February twentieth we
               beard, like the roar of a dragon, the terrifying sound of a twenty-one gun salute.
               And on Sunday morning we received news of the capture of Lucknow, along with the information
               that the bright star of the skies of sovereignty, I mean the illustrious commander-in-chief,
               had attacked the rebel warriors with such skill that Mars, the commander of the heavens,
               blessed him, prayed for the safety of his hands and arms, and commended him at such
               length that his tongue wearied and his lips blistered. This was welcome news for the
               homeless, a propitious message of liberation, for the goal of the free and good-natured
               British was achieved and the rule of the vicious rebels was overthrown. I learned
               then that the gun salute and the music of the shah-nays had been in celebration of
               the seizure of power by the British. During this battle the generals of the victorious
               army were concerned with fearlessly slaughter¬ing their opponents, rather than with
               occupying the town. After killing and wounding as many of the enemy as possible they
               returned to their encampment.
            </p>
            <p>At a propitious time in the mid-morning of Wednesday, February twenty-fourth, the
               sole cyprus of the garden of justice, the bright moon of the glorious sky, the blessed,
               gracious and exalted one—I mean the Chief Commissioner Bahadur—with the hooves of
               his horses marked the ground of Delhi like the starry sky and, by means of a thirteen-gun
               salute, assured to the suffering the balm of love and charity.

            <p>Saturday, February twenty-seventh, came ,to an end and darkness fell over Delhi. When
               most of the night had passed such sighs from the hearts of the oppressed had risen
               into the skies that they obscured the face of the moon and the people cried out saying
               that the moon was eclipsed. On that same Saturday the orders of durbash came to an
               end and those who sought justice, or audience, or refuge were given these things.
               There is a prison outside the city and a house of detention inside. In both of these
               places so many people have been crowded together that it seems as if they must even
               be one inside the other. The angel of death alone knows how many people have been
               hanged by the neck in these two prisons. In the entire city of Delhi it is impossible
               to find more than one thousand Muslims ; and I am one of these. Some have gone so
               far from the city it seems as if they were never residents of Delhi. Many very important
               men are living out¬side the city at a distance of two to four kos, on ridges and thatched
               roofs, in ditches and mud huts, as if their fortunes were sleeping with blindfolded
               eyes. Among the people living in the wilderness are those who are anxious to return
               to Delhi, relatives of the imprisoned, and those living on alms, that is, on pensions.
               The ones who have sent petitions ask only for release from prison, permission to live
               in Delhi, and renewal of their pensions. The courts have received two or three thousand
               petitions from the supplicants. These seekers after justice keep eyes and ears open
               so that they may see and hear what the future holds for them.
            </p>
            <p>I, too, am eagerly awaiting a reply to the letter of respect and praise which I had
               sent by post. Because of my acute distress it was impossible for me to visit the administrator
               of Delhi at his residence. In short, there are hardships encompassing me on all sides
               as if I am surrounded by thorns. If one goes abroad one will find them spread on the
               path, if one remains inside, thorns stick to one's clothes. Until now forebearance
               had restrained impatience and on Monday, the eighth of March, the letter was returned
               to me with a note. The face of the letter was illumined with the prudent administrator's
               decree that it be returned to the sender to be channelled properly through the district
               authorities. Everyone said, and I also thought it myself, that this answer was a promising
               sign and not devoid of advantage and that it would be likely that my representations
               would be accepted. I sent the letter which contained these orders, with a suitable
               additional note, to the just, charitable and prudent Charles Saunders, Chief Com¬missioner
               Bahadur, along with an accompanying memorandum to the afore-mentioned acclaimed lord
               relating to my old•desire for the renewal of my pension. On Wednesday, March seventeenth,
               a communication arrived stating that my first letter (the panegyric), which contained
               nothing but congratulations, should not have been sent. I said to myself that during
               these turbulent days there was no place for love and affection, happiness and felictiy.
               I am merely a slave t• my belly and seek only bread. Let us see what is the outcome
               regarding my second wish.
            </p>
            <p>On the evening of Friday, March eighteenth, the soul-shattering sound of gunfire again
               rang through the blue skies, heralding the victory at Lucknow and the spread of the
               venge¬ful British armies throughout the town. There is no fort in the town, no city
               wall, no gate, and undoubtedly it was the compact wall of the rebel army that was
               obstructing the advance of the courageous British. Surely when this solid wall was
               breached by the whirlwind onslaught of the brave British soldiers it must have given
               way and the length of the thorough¬fare must have been buried in dust because of the
               passage of these horsemen and foot soldiers. When the Lord confers sovereignty He
               confers dignity also and the talent for victory. Because of these things, who¬soever
               opposes the will of the ruler merits punishment, fOr to oppose the king is to do harm
               to oneself. It is fitting for the people of the world to obey those whom the Lord
               has blessed with good fortune and, in obeying them, they should consider it obedience
               to the Lord himself. When one understands that fortune, power and sovereignty are
               the gifts of the Lord there should then be no occasion for disaffection or for disobe¬dience.
               How skilfully this idea has been put into verse by that gifted ornament of music,
               Sa`cli, of Shiraz :

            <p>Since the twenty-second of March the heart of this demented one has been stricken
               because throughout the world it is the month of Farwardin; and Nau-roz—the day that
               lights up the earth—falls within these two or three days. This year, since the city
               has become the abode of the dead, we hear no shouts of pleasure at the arrival of
               spring. Nobody can tell me when, according to the Turkish calendar, this year began
               and nobody can tell me which is the day of the equi.. nox. If all of the astronomers
               have died, and no longer write daily of matters pertaining to the travels of the solar
               king, then it can be presumed that we have fewer liars, and that we have listened
               to fewer lies. But the sun has not forgotten to remain in Aries and so the vegetation
               still grows, the flowers still bloom and the principles of birth do not change ; for
               it is not possible for the skies to alter their fixed laws of rotation.

            <p>I weep and I think that the times are completely un-caring. If I, who am closed in
               my corner of grief, cannot look at the green and the flowers or, by smelling the sweet
               flowers, fill my mind with perfume—the beauty of spring will not be diminished, and
               no one will punish the breeze. During the month of April, of which two thirds is com¬prised
               of Farwardin and one third of Urdi, those who still remained in prison with Hakim
               Mahmud Khan were released and went on their various ways. The serene, high-born Hakim
               Mahmud Khan, with his wife, children, relatives and retainers set out for Patiala.
               They say he is now in Karnal and his future plans are not known.
            </p>
            <p>Early in May I was happy to hear the news that the intrepid British soldiers bad conquered
               Muradabad which was on the route held by the depraved rebels, The city was then presented
               to that fountain of knowledge and wisdom, the noble Nawwab Yusuf Ali Khan Bahadur,
               and so received the crown of justice. He who is capable of conquering and ruling the
               world, now, under orders of the British, rules over this province and I hope will
               continue to do so. Further, it is reported that the mountain-shattering, dragon-killing
               army invaded Bareilly and the rebels were thrown out like flotsam tossed up by powerful
               waves. Judging from the events so far, one can hope that the regime of the stubborn
               rebels who still remain to torment the occupants of towns and villages and to harass
               those who- walk on the streets, will soon come to an end and the whole area pass under
               the banner of the righteous rulers. During the evening of Sunday, June thirteenth,
               the city administrator summoned Bahadur Jung Khan, who had been imprisoned in the
               Fort. This man answered the summons with high hopes and there be was given the welcome
               news that he had been pardoned, and had been granted a pension of one thousand rupees
               a month. However, he was also ordered to leave Bareilly for Lahore ; and although
               he would then be a free man, he could live nowhere but in Lahore. Certainly it would
               be prudent of him to shake of his grief over the loss of wealth and position, and
               to be cheerful and contented with his freedom. The King of Day, that is the Sun, whose
               head rotates on a spear, had risen up from the east more than the length of a spear
               when, fierce as lightning, twenty-one gun salutes rang out. The number of these salutes
               was equal to the lapsed days of this month of June and they filled the hearts of the
               faithful with joy and spread ashes hotter than the fires of grief over the heads and
               faces of the enemy. By the capture of the city of Gwalior and its rocky fort—which
               is truly the heart of the world and the darling of the mountains—the death decree
               of the rebels was issued from the court of the Lord, and the British rulers and their
               allies rejoiced at this good news which lit the lamp of their ambition.
            </p>
            <p>This is the story : When the rebels captured Gwalior, Maharaja Jayaji Rao, the monarch
               of Gwalior, fled his city and his realm and went to Agra to seek the help of the British.
               With their support he re-took the city. The rebels had con¬verged on Gwalior from
               many different directions but there they suffered a severe defeat. So now they will
               be scattered and, in weakness and disarray, they will rove and plunder until, finally,
               they will be disgracefully defeated everywhere and their forest-running horses will
               die in plains that are without water and without grass. From that time on the land
               will be rid of thorns and thistles and the gardens will bloom and every path will
               glitter again like the bazaar. Sixty-three years of the life of this writer have gone
               by. Because of the sorrows that consume my soul I cannot hope to live much longer.
               Therefore let me recite some verses of the magic poet of Shiraz (Sa‘di), God bless
               his soul, and as one sufferer to another I repeat these verses, if not to bring joy
               to my heart, at least to find relief from the pangs of sorrow and despair.

            <p>To conceal the truth is not, in fact, the practice of honour¬able men. I am only half
               Muslim, and quite free from the rigidities of religion ; and I am unconcerned with
               slander and infamy. It has always been my habit at night to drink a foreign wine and
               if I cannot have it I cannot sleep. During these days the price of English wine has
               become prohibitive and I have no money at all. If it bad not been for one who knows
               and loves the Lord, the generous Mahesh Das, bounteous as the river, I would have
               died of my consuming thirst. This man sent me Indian wine made of sugar, with a bouquet
               even superior to that of imported wine, with which to cool the fire of my heart.

            <p>I cannot resist letting it be known that this kindly man left no stone unturned in
               his effort to bring back the Muslims to the city but, as it was not the will of the
               Lord, he did not succeed. Everyone knows that it is because of the gracious administrator
               that the Hindus now live freely in the city. However, that lover of righteousness
               and virtue, Mahesh Das, has had a hand in these affairs. in brief, he is a much blessed
               man, considerate of others, and lives in comfort and felicity. Although we have not
               known each other long and meet to talk only occasionally, now and then he favours
               me by send¬ing a gift. Among my pupils and associates is Hira Singh, a well-known
               youth, conscious of his duties, who comes to me very often and dispels my sorrow.
               There is another discerning young man in this half-inhabited, half-empty city, who
               is as dear to me as a son—I mean the excellent Shivji Ram Brahman. He seldom leaves
               this sorrowing dervish alone and in every way tries to assist me and to obey my wishes.
               His son Bal Mukund, a courteous and reverent youth, always does what I ask of him
               and is always ready to share my sadness.
            </p>
            <p>Among the friends who live :at a distance Is Bar Copal ‘Tafta', the full moon of the
               sky of love, the sweet-tongued poet and my dearest friend and intimate. Since he considers
               me his master, his poetry, endowed with all God-given excellence, is my proud treasure.
               In short, he is a fine man, full of affec¬tion and sincerity. He is renowned for his
               verse and because of him the poetry readings are full of warmth. In my great love
               I think of him as part of my own soul and I have given him the title of Mirza Tafta.
               He has sent me a hundi and regularly sends letters and ghazals from Meerut. These
               things, which are not actually necessary to record, I have written down in order to
               thank these people for their generosity and love. Also, when this account reaches
               the hands of my friends, I want them to know that the city is empty of Muslims—their
               houses are not lit at night and during the day their chimneys give forth no smoke.
               And Ghalib, who had thousands of friends in the city and acquaintances in every house,
               now in his loneliness, has none to talk with except his pen and no companion but his
               shadow.

            <p>If it had not been for these four people there would have been no witness to my helplessness.
               Blessed by the rotation of the skies, my house was spared the onslaughts of the raiders
               although during these days of plundering even the mud was looted from the houses of
               the city. However, I swear that nothing in my house has been saved except bedding
               and the few clothes which I am wearing.
            </p>
            <p>The solution to this perplexing enigma, the explanation of this paradox, is as follows
               when the rebels captured Delhi my wife, without telling me, gathered together all
               of our jewellery and precious things and sent them to the house of Kale Sahib, the
               son of a saint. There they were secured in a cellar and the entrance to the cellar
               was plastered over with mud. My wife revealed this secret to me when the British had
               conquered Delhi and their soldiers had been given orders to plunder the city ; but
               by then it was too late to go there to retrieve our possessiOns. I composed myself
               and consoled my heart with the knowledge that these things were destined to vanish
               ; and I was glad that it was not from my house that they were taken. It is now July,
               the fifteenth month since the start of the rebellion, and there seems to be no way
               for me to get back the old pension which I used to receive from the British government.
               I live by selling my clothes and my bedding. While others eat bread, I eat clothes.
               I am afraid that when I have sold all my clothes I shall die, naked, of starvation.
               During these anxious days, two or three of my old servants have stayed with me and
               I must care for them.. It is true that men cannot live without each other, and it
               is very difficult to live without a servant. In addition to these servants there are
               other needy people who have always looked to me for help, and even during these difficult
               times they call to me in a voice that eats away my soul. This soul-demolishing voice
               is as painful to me as the untimely crowing of a cock.
            </p>
            <p>Now that the weight of physical suffering and spiritual agony has broken both my body
               and my soul, I suddenly wonder how long I can continue embellishing this plaything
               with words. Surely the end of this struggle will be death, or beggary. In the first
               case there will be no alternative to the story remaining unfinished, and my readers
               disappointed. In the second case there will be no ending to the story except that
               Ghalib will be publicly turned out of a lane here and given some crumbs at a door
               there. How long can such things be told and how long can one be put to such shame
               ! Even if I now receive the balance of my pension the film of sorrow caused by my
               debts will not be wiped from the mirror of my heart. However, if I do not receive
               the arrears of my pension my heart will be broken in pieces as a mirror by a stone.
               Ruin is certain, and moreover, since the climate of Delhi is not congenial to this
               suffering one, I will have to leave the city and live in some other place. I have
               written herein an account of the events from May of last year to July, 1858. On August
               first I have laid down my pen. I long for orders from the auspicious sovereign con¬cerning
               the three petitions about which I have written in this book—that is, for title, for
               robe of honour, and for pension. My eyes and my heart look forward to this order from
               the Empress whose crown is the moon, whose throne is the sky ; who is as renowned
               as Jamshid, as splendid as Faridun, as majestic as Kaus, as noble as Sanjar, as exalted
               as Alexander ; to whom the Emperor of Rum is in debt for the preservation of his throne
               and the honour of his crown ; the Empress for fear of whose conquering armies the
               heart of Russia's czar is broken. Why does the sun tremble if not in terror of the
               Queen's dis¬pleasure at his burning heat ? Why does the moon wax and wane if not to
               seek forgiveness for lighting the world as if he were equal to the Queen ?

            <p>After completing this book, which is entitled Dastanbuy, it was sent to various people
               so that the souls of these persons of insight and knowledge might derive satisfaction
               from it and the stylists might admire its style. It is hoped that in the hands of
               the righteous this nosegay of wisdom will remain an ever-fresh bouquet but in the
               hands of the evil-minded it will be a hot ball. Amen.
